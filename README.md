My journey started when I collaborated with marketing teams on (human languages) website translations requiring me to learn basic html. After that I got a job as a complaints officer which was exciting as it mainly involved out of the box problem solving and dealing directly with complainants and stakeholders, however I wasn't satisfied with my ideas living just on paper, I wanted to see them come to live.

Thats when I joined Makers in July 2018. My journey at Makers has taught me the importance of best code practices and a healthy developer lifestyle.
I am a passionate ambitious junior developer looking for a role where I can extend my programming knowledge in a supportive environment where I can push myself out of my comfort zones and rapidly grow.

#### Commitment to what I am passionate about

I was the first employee to be promoted during my probation period (against company policy) from customer service to a complaints officer. I really enjoyed working in that role and was passionate about delivering what was promised. I was given some of the most difficult historical complaints to deal with based on my communication and negotiation skills. Pushing for a change in the way we communicated with out customers by holding regular meetings with department managers ensuring I have the most up to date information to communicate back to the complainant or come up with solutions departments can carry out to resolve the problem.


#### Communication and Collaboration

The thing I loved the most about working as customer service was the level of communication. It's a fast paced pressured close-knit environment that requires constant and regular communication in a specific way so that not to break the team spirit. It is the place that helped me collaborate with other teams by understanding customer and business needs and communicate between them. I worked with marketing teams on translating the website from customer perspective, insurance teams to negotiate a solution for the customer and building contractors to aid them in resolving their complaints.

Being in group projects at Makers helped me grow as a communicator. I learned about XP values and agile methodology. The Acebook project consisted of 6 team members and FEMO consisted of 4 team members. Communication was key, we had stand-ups in the morning, retros at the end of the day and checked in on each other in between, we made sure decisions were made collectively and everyone was up to date. We were able to move forward as one unit by ensuring everyone knows where we are in the project and feels valued.


#### Analytical thinker

I was a part of a team that achieved the lowest number of shipped fraudulent orders in high-end fashion and luxury clothing for children. I had to learn new skills on the go to catch up with the new ways of committing fraud. I learnt to analyse orders data and be able to pick out possible frauds.
